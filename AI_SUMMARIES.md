Here are 4 technical bullet points summarizing the Power BI blog for a professional:

* **Desktop and web data modeling parity**: Power BI now allows users to create and edit semantic models directly in the Power BI service, establishing core data modeling parity between Power BI Desktop and Power BI service, enabling end-to-end solution development entirely through a web browser.
* **Write Back Within Reports**: The introduction of translytical task flows (Preview) in Power BI enables users to trigger actions and write back data directly within reports, streamlining the decision-making process and reducing the need for external tools or workflows.
* **Unified experience with Microsoft Fabric**: Power BI's integration with Microsoft Fabric empowers users with a unified experience for data and AI-driven innovation, allowing creators to leverage the full power of the platform to turn data into action faster than ever.
* **Enhanced data modeling and version history**: The Power BI service now supports semantic model version history, allowing creators to track changes and collaborations, and automatically saves all changes, providing a more robust and collaborative data modeling experience.

Here are four technical bullet points summarizing the Power BI blog for a professional:

* Power BI now supports drillthrough for Direct Lake and DirectQuery semantic models via Excel's "Show Details" feature, allowing users to retrieve underlying detail rows by double-clicking a PivotTable cell.
* The updated functionality utilizes the MDX DRILLTHROUGH statement, which was previously only supported for Import models, and now enables consistent drillthrough experiences across Import, Direct Lake, and DirectQuery models.
* Drillthrough respects applied filters and security roles, including Row-Level Security (RLS) and Object-Level Security (OLS) configurations, ensuring that users can only access authorized data.
* The performance of drillthrough depends on the underlying source system and query complexity, particularly for semantic models in DirectQuery mode connecting to external data sources, and can be optimized by using explicit measures or fields that support detail rows.
