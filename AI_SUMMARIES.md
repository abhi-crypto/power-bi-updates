Here are 4 technical bullet points summarizing the Power BI blog for a professional:

* Power BI now supports drillthrough for Direct Lake and DirectQuery semantic models using Excel's Show Details feature, enabling retrieval of underlying detail rows without switching to Import mode.
* The MDX DRILLTHROUGH statement, previously only supported for Import models, is now supported for Direct Lake and DirectQuery models, allowing for a consistent drillthrough experience across all model types.
* Drillthrough in Direct Lake and DirectQuery models respects applied filters and security roles, including Row-Level Security (RLS) and Object-Level Security (OLS) configurations, ensuring secure and accurate data analysis.
* To use drillthrough, Excel users can connect to their semantic model using Analyze in Excel, double-click a leaf-level cell in the PivotTable, and view the underlying data, with performance dependent on the underlying source system and query complexity.
