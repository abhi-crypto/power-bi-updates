Here are 4 technical bullet points summarizing the Power BI blog for a professional:

* Power BI has removed the limitation on drillthrough functionality for Direct Lake and DirectQuery semantic models, allowing users to access underlying detail rows via Excel's Show Details feature.
* The MDX DRILLTHROUGH statement, previously only supported for Import models, is now supported for Direct Lake and DirectQuery models, enabling a consistent drillthrough experience across all model types.
* Drillthrough functionality respects applied filters and security roles, including Row-Level Security (RLS) and Object-Level Security (OLS) configurations, ensuring that users can only access authorized data.
* To use drillthrough, users can connect to their semantic model using Analyze in Excel, double-click a leaf-level cell in their PivotTable, and view the underlying data, with performance dependent on the underlying source system and query complexity.
